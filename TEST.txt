-----------------------------
Code Improvements
-----------------------------
Improving Index Construction:

Initial Code: Our original indexing process involved basic parsing of JSON files and 
indexing the text content without any advanced handling of document quality or relevance. 
This led to a lack of sophistication in prioritizing documents, often resulting in 
irrelevant or outdated content being highly ranked.

Updated Code: We introduced mechanisms to handle duplicate content and improve the 
relevance of indexed documents. Specifically, we implemented a hashing system to 
detect duplicate documents based on content hashes, ensuring that only unique content 
was indexed. Additionally, we enhanced our tokenizer to handle more complex text 
patterns, improving the accuracy of our text analysis. This refactoring also reduced 
the indexing time by optimizing data handling and enabling more efficient processing of documents.

-----------------------------
Advanced Ranking Algorithms:

Initial Code: The initial implementation lacked any form of advanced ranking logic, 
relying solely on basic frequency counts to rank documents.

Updated Code: We integrated the HITS and PageRank algorithms and compute the net relevance score 
to rank out results, which allowed us to consider the quality of documents based on the 
webâ€™s link structure. This not only improved the relevance of the search results but 
also prioritized authoritative sources, thus enhancing the overall user experience.

-----------------------------
Summarization Integration:

To enhance the presentation of search results and provide a quicker grasp of the documentâ€™s 
content, we integrated a summarization feature using the BART model. This tool generates brief 
summaries for each indexed document, which are displayed alongside the search results. 
This feature is particularly useful in helping users decide which links to follow based 
on a quick assessment of content relevance.

-----------------------------
Query Time Improvements:

Disk I/O: To address slow posting list reads from disk, we implemented a least recently 
used (LRU) caching mechanism, which has significantly sped up the query process.

Stop-word Handling: Our initial approach inefficiently processed stop-words, adding unnecessary 
bulk to search queries. We now employ a dynamic stop-word filtering mechanism. If the query 
contains a high number of stop-words, all are pruned; otherwise, only the least frequently used are considered.

Scoring Adjustments: It's important to note the balancing act between tf-idf and cosine similarity, 
ensuring that only similar results are retained. Additionally, the incorporation of PageRank and 
authority metrics from the HITS algorithm further refines our search results' relevance and quality.

-----------------------------
Impact on Query Results
The improvements in our indexing and ranking algorithms have had a profound impact 
on the quality of our search engineâ€™s output:

1. Relevance: By incorporating advanced ranking algorithms and enhancing content analysis, 
the search results are now more relevant and closely aligned with user queries.
2. Accuracy: Improved error handling and the exclusion of duplicate content have significantly 
reduced the occurrence of irrelevant and outdated information in the search results.
3. Authority: With the integration of HITS and PageRank, documents from authoritative sources are 
ranked higher, which has improved the trustworthiness and quality of the information presented to users.
4. Speed: Enhanced indexing algorithms and error handling have also led to quicker query 
processing, reducing the average query response time.

-----------------------------
Conclusion
-----------------------------
Our engine now not only understands the content better but also appreciates the importance of 
document authority, thus providing more relevant and authoritative results. Each test query helped us 
identify and rectify shortcomings in our initial setup, leading to a robust and efficient search system.
