-----------------------------
Code Improvements
-----------------------------
Improving Index Construction:

Initial Code: Our original indexing process involved basic parsing of JSON files and 
indexing the text content without any advanced handling of document quality or relevance. 
This led to a lack of sophistication in prioritizing documents, often resulting in 
irrelevant or outdated content being highly ranked.

Updated Code: We introduced mechanisms to handle duplicate content and improve the relevance 
of indexed documents. Specifically, we implemented a hashing system to detect duplicate 
documents based on content hashes, ensuring that only unique content was indexed. Additionally, 
we enhanced our tokenizer to handle more complex text patterns, improving the 
accuracy of our text analysis.

-----------------------------
Advanced Ranking Algorithms:

Initial Code: The initial implementation lacked any form of advanced ranking logic, 
relying solely on basic frequency counts to rank documents.

Updated Code: We integrated the HITS and PageRank algorithms and compute the net relevance score 
to rank out results, which allowed us to consider the quality of documents based on the 
web’s link structure. This not only improved the relevance of the search results but 
also prioritized authoritative sources, thus enhancing the overall user experience.

-----------------------------
Error Handling and Data Integrity:

Initial Code: There was minimal error handling in place, which often resulted in the inclusion 
of error pages (e.g., 404s) in search results.

Updated Code: Improved error detection mechanisms are now in place to exclude non-existent 
pages from the index. Additionally, we implemented robust error handling throughout the indexing 
process to prevent system crashes and ensure data integrity.

-----------------------------
Impact on Query Results
The improvements in our indexing and ranking algorithms have had a profound impact 
on the quality of our search engine’s output:

1. Relevance: By incorporating advanced ranking algorithms and enhancing content analysis, 
the search results are now more relevant and closely aligned with user queries.
2. Accuracy: Improved error handling and the exclusion of duplicate content have significantly 
reduced the occurrence of irrelevant and outdated information in the search results.
3. Authority: With the integration of HITS and PageRank, documents from authoritative sources are 
ranked higher, which has improved the trustworthiness and quality of the information presented to users.

-----------------------------
Conclusion
-----------------------------
Our engine now not only understands the content better but also appreciates the importance of 
document authority, thus providing more relevant and authoritative results. Each test query helped us 
identify and rectify shortcomings in our initial setup, leading to a robust and efficient search system.
