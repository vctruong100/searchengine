TEST.txt
-----------------------------
This report evaluates the effectiveness of our search engine's
indexing and ranking algorithms across a set of 20 test queries.


Improvements
-----------------------------
We refined the indexing process by pruning duplicate documents
that were exact or near.

We also accounted for important tags (title, bold, headings)
within our postings, and integrated PageRank and HITS scores
into each document by keeping track of the URLs in
each document.

Our search engine uses cosine similarity in addition to TF-IDF
sums and promotes terms based on its importance. These are
mixed with a static quality score per document, which is
computed as a mix of PageRank and HITS scores.

To improve query times, we used a cache on postings retrieval
to avoid expensive disk reads and pruned stopwords in our queries
where necessary (that is if there were too many stopwords or
too little).


Report
-----------------------------
Initial performance and query time (avg in milliseconds) use M2
as a basis.

We use 10 good, 10 bad queries from M2 to evaluate the search
engine performance.

Each query is divided by a set of brackets [ ] with a number.

Note: The first 10 queries that performed well in M2.
The last 10 queries performed poorly in M2.


[ 1 ]
query: "pattis notes"

initial
    - time: 15.68ms
    - performance:  Our queries are related to pattis's website
                    and contains many relevant notes for his
                    course offerings.

final
    - time: 10.50ms
    - performance:  Our query does return fewer results from
                    pattis's course offerings, but in exchange,
                    we find pattis's main website and a new URL
                    referencing more detailed notes as opposed to
                    "frameindex.html". This uses cosine scoring and
                    quality to achieve such results while remaining similar.


[ 2 ]
query: "uci gaming"

initial
    - time: 84.31ms
    - performance:  We saw many queries related to a GameLab
                    presentation which is closely tied to our
                    query to an extent.

final
    - time: 14.37ms
    - performance:  Our queries have similar ranked results
                    with the GameLab presentation pages
                    dominating our results, which means our
                    changes did not affect this query.


[ 3 ]
query: "thornton ics 33"

initial
    - time: 50.88ms
    - performance:  The results are closely related to thornton's ICS
                    33 website as expected of our query.

final
    - time: 6.25ms
    - performance:  Our changes minimally affected the results.
                    The only difference is that one of the pages from
                    thornton's ICS 46 course page is shown in place of
                    thornton's home website.


[ 4 ]
query: "SQL"

initial
    - time: 15.72ms
    - performance:  We see page references to courses closely related
                    to SQL such as cs122b and cs122a.

final
    - time: 5.30ms
    - performance:  There is a noticeable difference in time possibly
                    from our postings cache retrieval, which improves
                    for subsequent queries. The results remain similar
                    too with even diferent references such as Intro to Data
                    Management class under thornton's ICS 184.

query: "to be or not to be that is the question"

initial
    - time: 416.77ms
    - performance:  Our query engine struggles to process
                    many stopwords at a time, which meant
                    the query time exceeded past our allowed time.

final
    - time: 266.48 ms -> 34.13 ms
    - performance:  We made changes to how we parse stopwords
                    by selecting only a few stopwords, namely
                    the stopwords that were least frequent.

                    The cache on postings retrievals also
                    makes subsequent queries on stopwords fast.
                    The time improvement from using the cache is
                    denoted by the right arrow.


[ 12 ]
query: "Ics"

initial
    - time: 84.31ms
    - performance:  Our queries mostly returned results from
                    irani's 6B and 6D pages, which is perhaps
                    too focused for our broad query.

final
    - time: 73.27ms
    - performance:  Our queries are now broader, and the main
                    ICS website can actually be found in the queries.
                    Important text along with our tuning of the
                    individual quality factors helped achieve these results.


[ 13 ]
query: "mondego"

initial
    - time: 1.08ms
    - performane:   The results does not show mondego at the top of the
                    rankings, only as the 4th result. In fact, a news
                    site congratulating mondego is shown at the top

final
    - time: 1.39ms
    - performance:  The results change the ordering such that the "mondego"
                    main website is at the top. We achieve this by using
                    important text promotions to emphasize the main website.


[ 14 ]
query: "I need assistance"

initial
    - time: 31.24ms
    - performance:  While the query is related to lab assistants, it's possible
                    the query could mean other things such as help with general
                    UCI affairs. Additionally, the last query references a project,
                    which is not very "assistance"-related. There were also
                    duplicates, which is not ideal.

final
    - time: 9.46ms
    - performance:  Our queries now return a link to an accessibility page along
                    with student affairs. At the same time, our query continues to
                    have lab assistants listed. Duplicates are no longer returned.
                    Cosine similarity and duplicate detection helped with improving
                    this query.


[ 15 ]
query: "print("Hello world!")"

initial
    - time: 0.00ms
    - performance:  The query did not return any useful
                    results which was strange for a basic
                    Python construct.

final
    - time: 2.48ms
    - performance:  The query now returns the proper results.
                    We fixed this by improving the tokenization
                    of the query with minimal time difference.
                    This also points to basic Python exercises,
                    which is expected for this basic Python code.


[ 16 ]
query: "Advancements in quantum computing"

initial
    - time: 73.10ms
    - performance:  The query contained many duplicates for our top
                    results, which is not very useful if you want
                    to know about other advancements in quantum
                    computing.

final
    - time: 0.00ms
    - performance:  We saw duplicates removed from our results.
                    Additionally, the query points to quantum
                    as a CS research area and news/notes, which
                    showcase quantum computing advancements.
                    The query also maintains the top result from
                    our initial engine as the 4th result.

                    Duplicate detection helped us achieve these
                    results along with static quality scoring
                    from pagerank / HITS.


[ 17 ]
query: "The way that something is done in a particular area of study at a place 
where people do research and study"

initial
    - time: 425.7808ms
    - performance:  This query is overly wordy and filled with 
                    common words and phrases that add little 
                    value to the search intent. The result of the 
                    query contains many duplicates and not many useful 
                    results, such as catalogue of books, table of 
                    contents for some pages, etc.

final
    - time: 0.00ms
    - performance:  After refining the indexing process and applying 
                    advanced ranking algorithms like PageRank and HITS, 
                    the search results now focus more on high-quality 
                    academic and research-oriented pages. Duplicate 
                    documents have been pruned significantly, and the 
                    use of important tags within postings has improved 
                    the relevance of the search results. 

[ 18 ]
query: "Error Code: 0xC1900210"

initial
    - time: 6.6042ms
    - performance:  Although the query is specific, it does not 
                    successfully retrieve results for the designated 
                    error code. Instead, it produces unrelated error 
                    information, making the results irrelevant.

final
    - time: 10.1134ms
    - performance:  With the integration of PageRank and HITS scores, 
                    along with better handling of technical and specific 
                    terms through cosine similarity and TF-IDF adjustments, 
                    the search now accurately retrieves documents 
                    specifically related to the error code. This includes 
                    technical support content and troubleshooting guides, 
                    enhancing the relevance and utility of the results.


[ 19 ]
query: "Random words without sense or meaning"

initial
    - time: 56.4514ms
    - performance:  The query yields mixed outcomes. The initial 
                    two results are off-target, yet the third result 
                    is notable, featuring a document that contains an 
                    extensive compilation of words or characters. The
                    rest fail to achieve the same outcome.

final
    - time: 24.4754ms
    - performance:  Enhanced filtering and prioritization through 
                    adjusted ranking algorithms now dismiss irrelevant 
                    content faster, reducing query time. The updated 
                    search better manages nonsensical input by filtering 
                    out noise and focusing on potentially meaningful
                    content, even when presented with random words.


[ 20 ]
query: "what is computer science"

initial
    - time: 100.4972ms
    - performance:  The result query fails to provide answer to the 
                    query question and instead provide irrelevant pages 
                    like publications and text files.

final
    - time: 86.5675ms
    - performance:  The refined search results now prominently feature 
                    educational resources, departmental websites, and 
                    introductory articles about computer science. 
                    Improvements in document relevance through enhanced 
                    use of PageRank and HITS scores, along with the 
                    promotion of important textual content, have yielded 
                    more pertinent results that directly address the 
                    query's intent.
