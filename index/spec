Index file format
=================

There are 2 kinds of index file formats: `partial` and `merged`.

The `partial` format represents an incomplete inverted index as a sequence of 
partial indices.

The `merged` format represents a complete inverted index with all partial 
indices from the `partial` format merged together as one.


Partial
=======

The header of the partial format is written as such:
```
struct partial_header {
    u32 partcnt;
    u64 highest_docid;
};
```

`partcnt` refers to the amount of inverted indices on file. Each time a new 
partial index is written to, this increments by 1.

`highest_docid` refers to the highest document ID stored across all inverted 
indices on file. Typically, this is supplied by the user when the user calls
`write_partial_index(...)`.


A sequence of key-value maps follows after the header. Each key-value map must 
write its keys in lexicographic order sequentially. A map is written as such:
```
struct str {
    u32 len;
    char[] buf;
};

struct partial_key_val_pair {
    struct str key;
    u32 postings_size;
    Posting[] postings;
};

struct partial_key_val_map {
    u32 map_size;
    struct partial_key_val_pair[] pairs;
};
```

We define a string as a `struct str` with a `u32` for its length followed by a 
sequence of `char` with the length based on its length.

We define a list of postings with the size that it occupies in bytes as `u32` 
followed by a byte sequence representing many Posting objects. Posting objects 
are encoded to bytes using the `Posting.encode()` method.

The key-value map is defined as a sequence of key-value pairs prepended by the 
size it occupies in bytes. Note that a map is always a mapping of strings to a 
list of Postings.
